# Google-Play-vs-Apple-Store

In this project, we are designing a custom operating system and integrating an app store into it. Our goal is to choose the app store that sells the highest quality apps. We have two options: integrating the Apple Store or Google Play, but not both.

To determine which platform to use, we decided to use app ratings as a quality metric. We gathered data on app ratings from both stores and analyzed whether there is a significant difference between the ratings on the two platforms.

In this case study, we aim to investigate whether one platform has significantly higher ratings than the other, which would justify choosing that platform over the other. If there is no significant difference between the ratings, we will randomly choose which platform to integrate into our operating system.
